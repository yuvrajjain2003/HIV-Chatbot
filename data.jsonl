            From CDC Video
            What is HIV? HIV is a virus that attacks a person's immune system. Most people get HIV through anal or vaginal sex or by sharing needles and other drug injection equipment with a person who has HIV.
            
            How do you get HIV? HIV can also be passed by a pregnant woman to her baby during pregnancy, childbirth,
            or later through breastfeeding. Without treatment, HIV can make a person very sick or even cause death.
            
            Prevention. The only way to know if you have HIV is to get tested. Knowing your status can help you make healthy decisions. To prevent getting HIV take medicine called PrEP if you are at high risk. Always use condoms or clean needles, never share needles, or choose not to have sex or inject drugs.
            
            If you have HIV, get in care and take HIV medicine as prescribed. With the right medical care, you can live a long, healthy life and prevent transmission to others.

            •	HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. Having HIV makes a person more likely to get other infections and diseases. HIV is spread by coming in contact with the body fluids (blood, saliva, semen) of someone who has HIV. HIV is most often spread through unprotected sex or the sharing of drug injection needles.
            •	AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is a disease that forms as a result of untreated HIV. AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection and happens when the body’s immune system is badly damaged by the virus.

            Women of color in the US have a greater chance of getting HIV than white women. The graphic below shows the differences in the chances of getting HIV by race, as well as some likely reasons why there are differences. 
            
            The number of U.S. Women (per 1000) who will get HIV in their lifetime, by race:
            •	Black women – Around 19 per 1000
            •	Hispanic/Latina women – Around 4 per 1000
            •	American Indian/Alaska Native women: Around 3 per 1000
            •	Asian women: Around 1 per 1000
            •	White women: Around 1 per 1000
            
            Why are there such large differences in women’s HIV risk by race?
            Institutionalized racism affects the issues below:
            •	Poverty – Black women experience poverty more than women of other races. Black women in poverty may find it harder to get HIV prevention and care services
            •	Healthcare access issues – Because of racism and poverty, Black women struggle to get access to health care. This leads to more people getting HIV and fewer people getting treated for it.
            •	Incarceration of Black men – Incarceration removes men from their family, leaving behind their partners who lose support. This increases the number of Black men and women in poverty.

            Watch the CDC video to learn more about why HIV testing is important [Transcript]
            The only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested.
            Everyone ages 13 to 64 should get tested for HIV at least once in their lifetime.
            If you have certain risk factors,
            you should get tested more often.
            For example...
            ...if you’ve had more than one sex partner
            or your sex partner has had more than one partner since your last HIV test,
            you should get tested again.
            If you continue to inject drugs and share needles or drug injection equipment,
            you should get tested at least once a year.
            If you’re a sexually active gay or bisexual man,
            you should think about getting tested every 3 to 6 months.
            Testing can be quick and easy.
            Some tests take as little as 20 minutes,
            and some don’t even involve a needle.
            You can also buy a self-test at a drugstore or online.
            To find a testing site near you,
            visit gettested.cdc.gov.

            •	Also protect you from pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)
            •	You do not need to get a prescription or see a doctor to get male condoms
            •	Condoms have no side effects unless you are allergic to latex

            •	Male condoms are not a great option if you are trying to get pregnant.

A condom should be worn for any genital-to-genital contact (such as dry humping) and for oral, vaginal, and anal sex.

            If the condom breaks at any time, stop sex immediately. Pull the penis out of the receiving partner, take the broken condom off the penis, and put a new condom on. You can then safely continue. 
            
            Using a water-based or a silicone-based lubricant with a condom can help keep the condom from tearing. Oil-based lubricants can weaken a condom and cause it to break.

            What do people like about male condoms?
            •	You do not need to get a prescription or see a doctor to get male condoms.
            •	Some men say that female condoms feel better for them than male condoms.
            •	Also protect you from pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
            •	You can use a female condom even if your partner doesn’t want to wear a male condom. You put it in place yourself and your partner may not notice it.
            •	Female condoms can be found in pharmacies and health departments. They are easy to carry with you, and can be used with little to no preparation.
            •	You can put a female condom in place hours before having sex. This means you can have sex without stopping to first put on the condom.
            
            What do people not like about female condoms?
            •	Female condoms are not a great option if you are trying to get pregnant.
            •	Some people think female condoms are noisy.
            •	Female condoms are less popular and can be harder to find than male condoms.
            •	Less effective at preventing HIV if the condom is not used properly. It can take some time to get used to using condoms.
            •	You have to use a new condom every time you have sex.
            •	There may be a higher risk of developing a urinary tract infection (UTI) if you leave a female condom in place for too long. Do not leave it in place for more than 8 hours.

            Female condoms are a single-use barrier method that stops you and your partner’s body fluids (such as blood, vaginal fluids, and semen) from coming in contact. Since HIV is only carried in certain body fluids, this barrier lowers your chances of getting HIV.
            
            NOTE: A female condom should never be rolled onto an erect penis. You should not use a female condom at the same time as a male condom. This may make it more likely that one (or both) will break.

            PrEP doesn’t work as well when not taken daily as prescribed
            •	The effectiveness of PrEP ranges from 44-99% based on whether or not PrEP was taken every day.
            •	PrEP reduces the chances of getting HIV from injecting drugs by over 70%.
            
            You need a prescription to use PrEP
            Your doctor will do tests including an HIV test and a kidney function test before you start. You will need to see your doctor every three months for as long as you stay on PrEP.

            The drugs in PrEP are made to stop people from catching HIV, but they are not strong enough to control an active case of HIV if you are infected (source).
            
            If you have HIV and begin taking PrEP, PrEP won't fight HIV as it should.
            •	Using PrEP while having HIV may cause a type of the virus that is more resistant to treatment, meaning the treatment medication may not work as well.
            •	Taking PrEP while having HIV can lead to inconclusive or false-negative test results and a longer lag time between getting HIV and getting the treatment needed.
            •	For these reasons, it is very important to get tested every three months for HIV while using PrEP. 
             
            If you are taking PrEP and test positive for HIV, you should speak with your healthcare provider as quickly as possible. Your healthcare provider will confirm the results of your HIV test and help you decide on an appropriate treatment plan.
